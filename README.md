Introduction to Databases
A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It serves as a central repository for storing, managing, and querying data.

Relational Databases
Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a specific attribute of that record. They use structured query language (SQL) for querying and managing data. Popular relational database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

Non-Relational Databases
Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, provide flexible schema designs and are optimized for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are suitable for use cases such as real-time analytics, content management, and IoT applications. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Database Management Systems
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to interact with databases by providing an interface for defining, creating, querying, and managing data. DBMSs handle tasks such as data security, concurrency control, and data integrity. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Query Languages
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations such as data manipulation, data definition, and data control. NoSQL databases typically use their own query languages, such as MongoDB's query language.

Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them to avoid data anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

Indexing
Indexing is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations by creating data structures (indexes) that store references to the actual data. Indexes are typically created on columns frequently used in search and join operations.

Transactions
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work that must be executed atomically and consistently. Transactions ensure data integrity by either committing changes to the database or rolling back changes if an error occurs.

Backup and Recovery
Backup and recovery are essential processes for protecting data against loss or corruption. Backups are copies of data stored separately from the primary database, while recovery involves restoring data from backups in the event of a failure or disaster.
